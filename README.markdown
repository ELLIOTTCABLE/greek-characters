Anki Deck: Greek characters & alphabet
======================================
This is a collaboratively-improved [Spaced Repetition][] ([Wikipedia][wiki]) flashcard-deck to help you memorize the Greek character-set, useful in mathematics and (typed) software-development.

You use this deck by installing [Anki][], an excellent and widely relied-upon [open-source][source] SRS and flashcard program, written in Python, available for free for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and for pay on iOS.

Usage
-----
The simplest way to use this deck is to download it from AnkiWeb:

### <https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1871078367>

Alternatively, if you wish to modify this deck and collaboratively submit changes here on GitHub, you **must** import it with [CrowdAnki][], instead, **before** making any changes:

>  1. Open Anki's **“Decks”** window,
>  2. In the **“Tools”** menu, choose **Add-ons > Browse & Install ...**,
>  3. Copy-and-paste CrowdAnki's plugin identifier, **1788670778**, and hit “Ok”,
>  4. Restart Anki.

Next, create your own fork of this deck on GitHub, and download it:

>  1. [Sign up][] for a free GitHub account:
>

>  2. [Fork][] this repository to your own account:

>     <img src="http://i.ell.io/hjO4rY+?.png" width="500">
>
>  3. Install [GitHub Desktop][] and log-in.
>
>  4. “Clone” your new fork to your computer:

>     <img src="http://i.ell.io/TmZ5nz+?.png" width="500">
>
>  5. Open the “File” menu, choose **CrowdAnki: Import from disk**, and navigate to that clone's folder:

Now, you can make your changes to the deck inside Anki.

When you're done with some changes, and wish to submit them, you must *commit*, *push*, and *pull-request* those changes so that I see them:

>  1. Click the ‘gear’ icon next to your updated deck in Anki, and choose “Export”:
>
>     <img src="http://i.ell.io/DstG19+?.png" width="500">
>
>  2. Select the “CrowdAnki JSON representation” format, ensure “include media” remains checked, and hit “Export...” (Make sure to select the *parent directory* when exporting — that is, most likely, the `~/Documents/GitHub` folder itself.)
>
>     <img src="http://i.ell.io/zFSPLE+?.png" width="500">
>
>  3. Open GitHub Desktop, which should now show the changes you've made to the deck (don't worry too much if what you see here is confusing; the format is not designed to be human-readable!); write a short (but descriptive) message in the text-field that says “Summary”, and then click “Commit to master!”

>  5. Then click the “Branch” menu, and select “Create Pull Request”,

>
>  6. ... and give your submission a title and a message to me!
