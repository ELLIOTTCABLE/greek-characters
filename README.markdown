Anki Deck: Greek characters & alphabet
======================================
This is a collaboratively-improved [Spaced Repetition Studying][SRS] ([Wikipedia][wiki]) flashcard-deck to help you memorize the Greek character-set, useful in mathematics and (typed) software-development.

You use this deck by installing [Anki][], an excellent and widely relied-upon [open-source][gh] SRS and flashcard program, written in Python, available for free for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and for pay on iOS.

Usage
-----
The simplest way to use this deck is to download it from AnkiWeb:

### <https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1871078367>

Alternatively, if you wish to modify this deck and collaboratively submit changes here on GitHub, you **must** import it with [CrowdAnki][], instead, **before** making any changes:

1. Open Anki's **“Decks”** window,
2. In the **“Tools”** menu, choose **Add-ons > Browse & Install ...**,
3. Copy-and-paste CrowdAnki's plugin identifier, **1788670778**, and hit “Ok”,
4. Restart Anki.

Next, create your own fork of this deck on GitHub, and download it:

1. [Sign up][] for a free GitHub account:

3. Install [GitHub Desktop][] and log-in.

4. “Clone” your new fork to your computer:

5. Open the “File” menu, choose **CrowdAnki: Import from disk**, and navigate to that clone's folder:

Now, you can make your changes to the deck inside Anki.

When you're done with some changes, and wish to submit them, you must “commit”, “push”, and “pull-request” those changes so that I see them:
