Anki Deck: Greek characters & alphabet
======================================
This is a collaboratively-improved [Spaced Repetition Studying][SRS] ([Wikipedia][wiki]) flashcard-deck to help you memorize the Greek character-set, useful in mathematics and (typed) software-development.

You use this deck by installing [Anki][], an excellent and widely relied-upon [open-source][gh] SRS and flashcard program, written in Python, available for free for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and for pay on iOS.
